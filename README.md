### What I learned

I learnt :

1. The picture element. With the picture element, you can have multiple images and switch between them according to media queries which you set with the media tag

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
<picture
  ><source srcset="" media="" />
  <img src="" /> <picture></picture
></picture>
```

2. The :is pseudo selector. Which helps group children of a particular element at once

```html

```

```css
.cart:is(:hover, :focus) {
  background: hsl(158, 36%, 20%);
}
```

3. General Css resets that can be applied before applying your own css like josh comeau's custom css reset.
